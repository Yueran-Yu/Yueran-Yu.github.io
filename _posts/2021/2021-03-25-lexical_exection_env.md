### Lexical Environment

- Where something sits physically in the code you write
    - 'Lexical' means 'having to do with words or grammar'. A lexical environment exists in programming languages in which **where** you write something is important.

### Execution Environment

- A wrapper to help manage the code that is running.
    - There are lots of lexical environments. Which one is currently running is managed via execution contexts. It can contain things beyond what you've written in your code.
    
### Object Definition
- A collection of name/value pairs
    - The simplest definition when talking about Javascript.
