### Problem of my demo code

The biggest problem of my code is a lot of coding logic jammed into one function.
This makes the code structure very unclear, making it difficult to read and track the logic, which, in turn, makes it almost impossible to unit test.

This is because I lack of experience of coding in a team,and I am unaware of the importance of unit test, and the importance of clear, concise module code for unit testing.
