### Problem of my demo code

Based on the interview meeting, the biggest problem of my code is a lot of coding logic jammed into one function.
This makes the code structure very unclear, making it difficult to read and track the logic, which, in turn, makes it almost impossible to do the unit test.

This is because I lack of experience of coding in a team,and I am unaware of the importance of unit test, and the importance of clear, concise module code for unit testing.

I read some articles about Jest a few days ago, React Hooks Testing Library and watching some videos, I struggled to write the first unit test. However, I was intimidated by my spaghetti code before it even started. Honestly, it's impossible to write a unit test with my messy code. 

At that time, a question popped into my mind, why are the unit test examples given by others so simple and easy, why there is no example suited for my complex code situation? 

#### <ins>From the interview I got the core answer, my code is an untestable mess.</ins>

It is obvious that the code with cluttered logic will be difficult to maintain and troubleshoot in the future as the program grows, and the number of codes increases.If we don't spend time writing unit tests at the early stage, we will definitely spend more time in the future constantly reworking, debugging and troubleshooting. 
Therefore, to ensure the quality of code at the beginning, writing unit tests immediately after each little coding function completed will be a multiplier thing with half effort.
